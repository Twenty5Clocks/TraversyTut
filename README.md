Technologies used in this tutorial:
* Django
* SQLite
* Python
* pipenv
* git
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Jinja


The frontend was mostly handled by Bootstrap standard items, While the Backend was handled by Django.

To run project:
1. Clone repository
2. python manage.py migrate
3. python manage.py runserver

You may have to get the required dependencies. I used pipenv for this project.

This project is complete and is now going to sit here for ever as a tool for me to review if needed. I wrote none of the code, but copying it manually did help me understand the framework better. I recommend this tutorial as it is short and to the point.
